# CodingPracticeJava
A repo of algorithmic problem solving challenges, test cases and useful functions that I've distilled from the practice.
Hopefully I can recreate this in other languages too soon enough.

##Layout
* Any solutions to problems from a website (such as codewars, codility etc.) have their own class and test class and are stored under a package named after the website
* Any solutions to general problems I've placed under **Other** (e.g., the Knapsack problem)
* Under the **utility** package are several classes that contain useful functions I've re-implemented myself. At the moment, most are functions to sort, search, sum, find averages etc. on arrays.
* Under the **test/testutility** package is a class called **TestMethods** which contains a bunch of useful methods, like timers and random array generators, to assist in writing good unit tests.
* Under the **datastructures** package are some of the basic data structures I've revised and re implemented myself.

**Please Note:** A lot of the solutions and implementations are not yet complete (and may never be...)
