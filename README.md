# JavaTools
This repo contains useful tools for solving problems in Java. I've developed the tools myself as an exercise in understanding various aspects of the language better. The tools were distilled from several solutions to various problems I've been trying to tackle. Some of the tools include java networking classes, utility classes for common functions over arrays and numbers, a testing super class which provides things like random arrays for use in unit tests, and more.
